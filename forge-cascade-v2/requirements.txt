# Forge Cascade V2 Dependencies
# Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# SECURITY FIX (Audit 3): Pinned all dependencies to exact versions
# to prevent supply chain attacks and ensure reproducible builds.
# Run `pip-compile --generate-hashes` for additional security.
#
# For modular installation:
#   pip install -r requirements-base.txt           # Core API only
#   pip install -r requirements-ml.txt             # Add ML features
#   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt            # Add dev tools
#
# For CPU-only ML (faster install, smaller):
#   pip install -r requirements-ml.txt --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# Include base dependencies
-r requirements-base.txt

# Include ML dependencies (optional but included by default)
-r requirements-ml.txt

# Include dev dependencies
-r requirements-dev.txt
