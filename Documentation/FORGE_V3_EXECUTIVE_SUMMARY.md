# FORGE V3 — Executive Summary

**Institutional Memory Engine for Enterprise AI**

---

## The Problem

Traditional AI systems suffer from **ephemeral wisdom** — knowledge is lost when models are retrained or upgraded. Organizations cannot audit, govern, or trust AI decisions over time.

---

## The Solution

**Forge V3** creates persistent, traceable, governable institutional memory. Every piece of knowledge is captured in **Capsules** — versioned containers with complete lineage tracking (Isnad), enabling organizations to preserve and monetize their collective intelligence.

---

## Core Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **7-Phase Pipeline** | Ingest → Analyze → Validate → Consensus → Execute → Propagate → Settle (~1.2s) |
| **Ghost Council** | 5 AI advisors providing democratic governance with weighted expertise |
| **Immune System** | Self-healing architecture with circuit breakers and anomaly detection |
| **Trust Hierarchy** | 5-tier access control from QUARANTINE to CORE |
| **Virtuals Integration** | Blockchain tokenization enabling autonomous, revenue-generating AI agents |

---

## Compliance & Security

- **400+ Technical Controls** across 25+ regulatory frameworks
- **GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, EU AI Act, SOC 2, ISO 27001** ready
- **Audit Trails** for every decision with cryptographic verification

---

## Business Model

| Usage Tier | Monthly Cost | Use Case |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| Starter | ~$50 | 100 queries/month |
| Business | ~$535 | 10,000 queries/month |
| Enterprise | ~$3,625 | 100,000 queries/month |

**Revenue Streams:** Inference fees (0.001 VIRTUAL/query) • Service fees (5%) • Governance rewards • Tokenization • Trading fees (1% Sentient Tax)

**Distribution:** Creator 30% • Contributors 20% • Treasury 50% (operations + buyback/burn)

---

## Target Markets

- **Regulated Industries** — Legal, biotech, finance requiring audit trails
- **Enterprise Knowledge Management** — Organizations preserving institutional wisdom
- **AI Governance** — Companies needing explainable, auditable AI decisions
- **Web3/DeFi** — Autonomous AI agents with tokenized revenue streams

---

## Technology Stack

**Backend:** Python 3.12, FastAPI, Neo4j (graph + vector DB), Redis
**Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
**Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus/Grafana
**Blockchain:** Base L2, Virtuals Protocol, GAME SDK

---

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Complete Lineage** — Unlike black-box AI, every decision is traceable
2. **Democratic Governance** — AI council + community voting prevents single points of failure
3. **Self-Healing** — Automatic failure detection, isolation, and recovery
4. **Monetization Built-In** — Knowledge becomes a revenue-generating asset
5. **Regulatory Ready** — 400+ compliance controls out of the box

---

## Codebase Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Lines of Code | 50,000+ |
| Backend Files | 93+ Python |
| Compliance Controls | 400+ |
| API Endpoints | 25+ |
| Jurisdictions Supported | 25+ |
